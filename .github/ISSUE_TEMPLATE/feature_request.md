## Is your feature request related to a problem?

A clear and concise description of what the problem is.

Examples:
- "It is hard to debug mistakes in `rules.txt` because the errors are not very clear."
- "I want to run the trained model on my phone, but there is no CoreML export."
- "I would like a simpler way to visualise games while training."

## Describe the solution you would like

Explain what you would like boardRL to do.

You can use the table below if it helps:

| Aspect          | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Feature summary | Short one-line summary of the feature            |
| Area            | e.g. rules parsing, agents, logging, CoreML, UI  |
| Type            | e.g. new feature / improvement / refactor        |

Then add more detail in plain text:

- What should change or be added?
- How would you expect to use it (example commands, files, etc.)?

## Describe alternatives you have considered

A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or workarounds you have tried or thought about.

Examples:
- Different way of writing the rules file
- Running a separate script
- Using a different RL library and why that does not fit boardRL’s design

## Additional context

Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.

Useful things to mention:

- Is this related to a specific game or `rules.txt`?
- Is this mainly for learning, research, or deployment (e.g. CoreML on iOS)?
- Any references, links, or examples from other projects that do something similar.
